# Metric_and_Performance

  In the context of the Diabetes dataset using Logistic Regression, key metrics from the scikit-learn metrics package include mean absolute error, mean squared error ,root mean squared error and squared error. These metrics provide insight into the model's performance by evaluating its ability to correctly predict diabetes cases (positive class) versus non-diabetic cases (negative class). 

  For the Titanic dataset using a classification model ( decision trees classifier), these same metrics from the metrics package help assess the model's ability to predict survival. Accuracy measures overall correctness, precision focuses on the proportion of true diabetic predictions among all positive predictions, and recall captures the proportion of actual survival  correctly identified. The F1 score balances precision and recall.
